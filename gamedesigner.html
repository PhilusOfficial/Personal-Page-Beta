    I’ve always liked videogames. Wait, don’t worry, what you’ll find here is not the usual story where one random guy
    says that he’s always liked videogames and that’s how he made a fortune and blah blah blah, no. This is something less
    exaggerated, but at least it’s not something you hear every day. <br>As I was saying, I’ve always liked videogames,
    but I’ve never been crazy about them. Playing them was fun, but that’s it. Well, this is true for the majority of
    videogames, except for one: Mario Kart. I got my first Mario Kart game when I was in elementary school; it was Mario Kart DS.
    After playing it, I got myself into a tunnel I still have to get out of. By the first grade of middle school, I was playing
    Mario Kart Wii, and it was amazing. I loved that game. But playing the same levels again and again was pretty boring.
    One year went away, and I discovered a pack of custom levels for the game that I had never seen before. They were called custom tracks.
    <br>After some time, I managed to understand how to download them and play them. By the end of second grade I knew not only how to play custom tracks, but also how to create them.
The process of creating a custom track is extremely long and complicated, so I won’t make you bored describing it.
These are some of the custom tracks I released during all these years. There also is a wiki dedicated to Mario Kart
Wii custom tracks. You can find my page on the wiki <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Multimariokartds">here</a>.
