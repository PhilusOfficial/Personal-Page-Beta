  <p class="text" id="section1">Hello, folks!<br>
    As you probably have noticed by visiting the home page, my name is Federico Lucifora.
    Why do I call myself a web surfer, you say? Well, it’s pretty simple.
    I currently have no job to brag about, and just writing that I’m a student isn’t really exciting.
    So, I told myself, what is that one word that describes the best what I do? The answer is straightforward:
    I have different passions and hobbies, but none of them really prevails over the others; but there is one thing they have in common,
    and that is that all of them origin from the internet. These are the words then: web surfer.<br><br>

    I’m currently a student of Communication Design at Politecnico di Milano. I previously attended Liceo Scientifico Filippo Lussana,
    in Bergamo, where I got my high school diploma.<br>I’m involved in different activities: I create custom videogame levels for the game
    Mario Kart Wii, called custom tracks. I started making them when I was in middle school, which let me reach a high level of knowledge of
    the English language, since the community of custom track creators is mainly an English-speaking community. I also have a YouTube channel
    where I seldom upload comedy videos. I also take photos for personal use or for small companies. I’m currently working on the backstage of
    a horror movie made by the company “Mafarka Film”; the photos are unavailable since the movie has yet to be released. Finally,
    I learned how to perform magic tricks with cards through the internet. I often try to surprise my friends and the people I meet with them.
    If you meet me in person, don't hesitate to ask me to show you something, and I'll try to surprise you the best way I can.<br>
    <br>So yeah, that’s it. This sums up the important things that need to be said in a personal page, or at least that’s what I think is enough.
    Want to learn some more? Go to the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, and click on the icons to visit their dedicated pages.
    Otherwise, you can simply go to the <a href="#top">My Skills</a> menu at the top of this page.
